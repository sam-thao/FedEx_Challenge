The Plan

Central Limit Theorem

Population 
µ = 72, σ = 3

We don't know the underlying distribution

Sample 
n = 36

36 boxes*

They will be picking the samples (boxes)

Picking a smaple won't work, there's no point since client will be picking the sample

We would use Sampling Distribution
*What would it look like? 

It would like a normal distribution.
The sample mean as the mean of population.
Standard devation is the same as the standard devation of the population divided by the √ of sample size. 
Sample size is going to be 36.

Sampling Distribution, n=36

µX̅ = µ = 72
σX̅ = σ / √36 = 3/6 = .05

Plane Capacity = 2,640 lb

x crit = 2,640 lb / 36 boxes = 73.06 lb per box
The boxes each cannot exceed 73.06 lb
mean = 72 lb, x crit 73.06 lb (to the right)
