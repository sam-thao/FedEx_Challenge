A business client has requested a large freight to be transported urgently from Denver to salt Lake City. When asked about the weight of the cargo they could not supply the exact weight, however they have specified that there are total of 36 boxes.

Form prior experience with this client you know that this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of µ = 72 lbs (32.66 kg) and a std. dev. of σ = 3 lb (1.36 kg).

The only plane you currenly have at Denver is a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan with a max cargo weight of 2,630 lb (1,193 kg).

Based on this information what is the probability that all of the cargo can be safely loaded onto the plane and transported?
